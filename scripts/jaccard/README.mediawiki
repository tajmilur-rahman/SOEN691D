== Calculate Jaccard Distance ==

# get the releases
# psql db_name -f get_release.sql

=== Calculate the Areas where the Developers Work ===

# ./dev_area_rel.pl config
# ./dev_area_merge.pl config
# ./dev_area_dev.pl config
# ./dev_area_rtr.pl config

# Get the releases with their corresponding duration
## ./get_release_period.pl config

#calcuate the jaccard between each stable release
## ./jac_dist_rel.pl config

=== Calculate Jaccard Distance within a Release Period ===

Tables jac_dist_rel and jac_dist should be created after running dev_area.sql

# jac_dist_rel.pl
## We are storing jaccard distance between different releases in the table '''jac_dist_rel'''
# jac_dist.pl
## We are storing the jaccard distance between different segments within a release period in the table '''jac_dist'''
