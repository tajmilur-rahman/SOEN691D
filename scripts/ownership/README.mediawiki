==Calculating Ownerships==

# file_info.sql
## This file creates file_info table.

# file_info.pl stores the information of all the files for every releases. Contains: file path, release, number of total commits, number of developers, total commits, total churns, first change, last change.
## There are 77082 distinct files in git_revision table that we are dealing with.
## Total record in fine_info table is 365788

# ownership_rel.pl
## Updated the table dev_area_rel with the ownership value for each author for every files worked on.
## After applying the operation we found ownerships for 582772 records form release 2.6.13 to 3.11 and for 14623 records only for the release 2.6.18. There were 1967 records having ownership 0 in total and only 4 records having ownership 0 in release 2.6.18.
## Calculated ownership for developers in releases. Churn and Commits both are in consideration
### Observed in a release 2.6.18.
### In the release period 2.6.18 there are total 8 files didn't have any churn made by any one ever. They where just committed.
### In release 2.6.18, 4 developers had ownership 0 for 4 different files those were committed by them.

           author          |                    path                    | churn 
---------------------------+--------------------------------------------+-------
 Kim Phillips              | arch/powerpc/configs/mpc834x_mds_defconfig |   0
 Jeff Garzik               | drivers/ata/libata-sff.c                   |   0
 Jeremy Fitzhardinge       | include/asm-i386/mach-visws/setup_arch.h   |   0
 Linus Torvalds            | sound/ppc/toonie.c                         |   0
[select author,path,churn from dev_area_rel where release = 'linuxv2.6.18' and ownership = 0;]

### We found Jeff Garzik worked in 352 files in the release period for 2.6.18 among them 1 file have this situation (i.e. no churn by Jeff Garzik even no churn by any one else ever).

   release    |            path            | churn | ownership | churn 
--------------+----------------------------+-------+-----------+-------
 linuxv2.6.18 | drivers/ata/sata_promise.h |     0 |   100.00  |   0

[select dr.release,dr.path,dr.churn,dr.ownership,fi.churn from dev_area_rel dr, file_info fi where dr.path=fi.path and dr.author like 'Jeff Garzik <%' and fi.churn = 0 and dr.release = 'linuxv2.6.18' and fi.release='linuxv2.6.18' group by dr.release,dr.path,dr.churn,dr.ownership,fi.churn;]

In this case although churn made by Garzik is 0, he got 100% ownership for the file because all the commits were made by Jeff Garzik.

### Now let's see why Jef Garzik got ownership 0% for the file drivers/ata/libata-sff.c
    author   |         path             | commits| churn | ownership
-------------+--------------------------+--------+-------+-----------
 Jeff Garzik | drivers/ata/libata-sff.c |   1    |   0   |   0.00
 Tejun Heo   | drivers/ata/libata-sff.c |   1    |   2   | 100.00

It's very simple, Tejuan Heo has made all 2 churns for this file so he deserves 100% ownership for this file because we are considering ownership mainly on the basis of churn, if total churn is 0 for that file, i.e. no one made any change ever for that file during a particular release then we are looking at number of commits and who made the commit.

# ownership_merge.pl
## Updates the table dev_area_merge with the ownership value for each author for every files worked on.
## Calculated ownership for developers in between the date of previous release and first rc data of the next release.

# ownership_dev.pl
## Updates the table dev_area_dev with the ownership value for each author for every files worked on within the development period of time in a release time. First rc date to the date of next release.

# ownership_rtr.pl
## Updates the table dev_area_rtr with the ownership value for each author for every files worked on just before the release after rc releases are done for the release and waiting for a stable release.
