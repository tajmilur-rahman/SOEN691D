\begin{abstract}
Different software projects practices different release models to compete in the field of software development. From the historical data of a large project we quantify aspects of developers' distribution, code ownership, different release periods, focus on the areas of the code-base, percentage of working with owned files during different periods within a release cycle for this project. This study reveals a unique process performing well extraction of data from Git for the development of a large open source project by which we can perceive well understanding on the release process and distribution of developers throughout the release providing us significant points of information that can lead us to further decisional analysis aiming novel solutions to the disruptive events for the practitioners of software development.
